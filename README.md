Muxall Remote Programmable Temp Controller Model Q (for BBQ) LCD Library

This library needs the muxall/ST7528i "Library for I2C graphical LCD based on Sitronix ST7528i" 

This library is part of my BBQ Controller for Traeger BBQ Grills project.  For more info
go to www.muxall.com.

There is an example Arduino sketch main.ino and it wasn't tested.
